MediGuardian is a health analysis platform that uses ML to spot diseases and keep an eye on health in real time. It relies on smart computer programs like Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVC) to do its job.

One of MediGuardian's main goals is to catch brain diseases like Parkinson's before they get bad. It looks at how people talk, move, and what their body signals say. Then, it uses its smart programs to find small problems that doctors might miss. This helps catch diseases sooner, which can slow them down and make life better for patients. MediGuardian also gives personal advice and keeps watching for any changes.
